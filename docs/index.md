# Read The Docs Theme for Jekyll and GitHub Pages

This is a port of the
[Read The Docs](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io) theme to
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so that it can be used with GitHub Pages.

You are previewing the theme right now, as you navigate
[this documentation](https://carlosperate.github.io/jekyll-theme-rtd):

The original [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org)
[theme]((https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io)) was created for the
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation generator, and so it is
designed specifically for docs.

Combined with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) it's a great and easy
way to document your projects!

### ðŸš§ Warning!

This theme is currently a **Work-In-Progress** but, while some things might be
broken, it should be already usable.

Missing features are listed in the GitHub issues with the
[to-do label](https://github.com/carlosperate/jekyll-theme-rtd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ato-do),
and any known issues are listed with the
[bug label](https://github.com/carlosperate/jekyll-theme-rtd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).

Contributions are very welcomed!


## Okay, but what is Jekyll, Read The Docs, GitHub Pages or why do I need to know any of this?

Well, you don't! For a quick walkthrough to get your docs up an running with
this theme see the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.html).

If you are interested to know more about all this continue reading :)

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator, you give it some
markdown files, select a theme, and it builds a static website.

But you still need to find a way to host it, and that's where GitHub Pages
enters the game.

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a service from
[GitHub](https://github.com) that allows you to easily build and host a website
from a GitHub repository.

Simply create a `docs` folder, add some markdown files, and with a couple of
clicks you can
[configure GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
to automatically build and publish a website for your project!

GitHub Pages uses Jekyll underneath, so this is a theme for Jekyll that can be
used with GitHub Pages as well.

- [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) is service offering free hosting
for project documentation. It's very flexible, but the easiest way to use
it is with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). Similarly to Jekyll, Sphinx
is also a static site generator, but focused on project documentation, and Read
The Docs provides a really nice theme for it.

I love the
[Read The Docs theme for Sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io), but
you still have to set up a Sphinx project, a Read The Docs account, and
configure the integration to automatically publish your documentation from
your GitHub repository.

### So?

For a project that is already in GitHub nothing beats the simplicity of GitHub
Pages, and so this theme is a port of Read The Docs Sphinx theme to Jekyll, so
that it can be used with GitHub Pages.
